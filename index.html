     <h3>Computer Programming Student</h3>
     <p>I am currently studying an online boot camp course on Udemy taught by Angela Yu.  This course starts at the beginning, introducing HTML5 and then progressing to CSS3, both front end coding languages.  Next, we will be moving on to tackling some back end coding such as Javascript. Wish me luck!</p>

     <h3>HTML5/CSS3</h3>
     <p>I completed a 300 hour code camp on the Free Code Camp site focused on HTML5 and CSS3 recently. That was a challenging first introduction for me and I realized I still had so much to learn.  Luckily, I was turned on to the course taught by Angela Yu and it has been filling in a lot of learning gaps. I enjoy expanding my skill set and learning how to use the Chrome Developer console to easily see under the hood, so to speak.</p>
